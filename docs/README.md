# QualiCharge API

QualiCharge developed an HTTP API to collect electric mobility-related data from charge point operators. We
focus on [EVSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station) static
(location, operator, etc.) and dynamic data (statuses and charging session) to
provide **high-quality** and **up-to-date** datasets to our national access point:
https://transports.data.gouv.fr ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

This documentation addresses different needs.

:point_right: If you intend to **send or fetch data** to/from our API, please
read our [API user's documentation](./user).

:point_right: Else, if you want to contribute to the project, we will write a
technical documentation soon. Stay tuned!
